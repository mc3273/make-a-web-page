				<span style="color:#0000FF"> Unit 1 Summary </span>
			</h1>

		<p>
				<br> The five most important things to take from this lesson are the following:

				<br> 
					<b> 1) What a Web Page is </b> - A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.

				<br> 
					<b> 2) How Coding Works </b> - Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:

				<br> 
					<b> 3) Computers are Not so "SMART" </b> - Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). For example, if you forget to close a bold tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.

				<br> 
					<b> 4) Programmers Can't Remember Everything </b> - There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.
		</p>
</div>
	<p>
		<b> Basic HTML Vocabulary </b>

			<br> 
				<b> Tag: </b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (" p " ' for example) and a closing tag, ("p"). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the "br" tag).

			<br> 
				<b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

			<br> 
				<b> Attribute:  </b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL,  " a href="www.udacity.com"  

			<br> Span and Div will be used often in this class! 							<b> Span is Inline and Div is a block element </b>

						<b> Google Chrome </b> - Has great develpment tools and allows one to breakdown a webpage and view the HTML tree Structure. While there are other browsers that have similar tools, we have chosen to use Chrome for simplicity of instruction. The knowledge and skills you acquire by using these tools will however easily translate to other similar developer oriented tools.

						<b> HTML Editor </b> - examples include Sublime Text, Bracket's, Notes Plus Plus. Learn to use the tools, they make your coding that much easier. I have also found many tutorial videos on you tube for Sublime text.

	 		<b> CSS - How it works and How to Use it </b>
	 		<br>
	 				<b> CSS Files </b> - You can have several sheets, all will be used to define page styles, think of it as laws that make the whole. The most specific rule is applied to every element, refers to cascading 	
	 		<br>		
	 				<b> Order Matters </b>

					It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions: the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)
					stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal) inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided)

				<br>	
					<b> Specifics Matter </b>

					"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

					That idea is known as inheritance and understanding it requires abstract thinking.

				<br>
					<b> Selecter </b>
				<br>	
					Write style that applies to class  e.g. description 
					Combine selectors 
					Very nice article on CSS selectors.

				<h1> <span style="color:#E00000"> Selecting a Class </span> </h1>

			lassing HTML elements, makes it possible to define CSS styles for classes of elements.

			Equal styles for equal classes, or different styles for different classes.

			In the example, we can set the background-color of every h1 to black. If you only want to add style to certain h1s, you can use class selectors. 

			Classing Block Elements

			The HTML "div" element is a block level element. It can be used as a container for other HTML elements.

			Classing "div" elements, makes it possible to define equal styles for equal "div" elements:

			Classing Inline Elements
			The HTML "span" element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text.

			Classing "span" elements makes it possible to design equal styles for equal "span" elements.

			<h1> <span style="color:#E00000"> Including CSS Styling in the web page  </span> </h1>

			<p>

				<b> Method 1: write CSS in the "head" of your HTML </b>

				This method is good for very small projects (like what you'd do in scratchpad.io). To do this: 1. At the top of your HTML document, add a "head" element. 2. Inside the "head" element, add a "style" element. 3. Write your CSS in the "style" element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file </b>

				This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this: 1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html). 2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. 3. Add a "head" element to the top of your HTML. 4. Add a "link" tag inside the "head" element. Since "link" is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing "link". 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b> Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML </b>

				This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it. If you want to know more, check out the question and answers in this conversation on Stack Overflow (Stack Overflow is the most widely used programming Q/A community out there).

				With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<b> Browsers </b>  use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements. You can view the default style rules for h1 and other elements for the following browsers:

				<br> 
					<b> WebKit </b> (Chrome and Safari) <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css"> Web Kit Link </a>
				<br>

					<b> Firefox </b>  <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/html.css"> Fire Fox Link </a>

				<br>	

				<b> Internet Explorer </b>

					<br> 
						Because these rules differ sometimes between browsers, there are efforts to promote consistency in styles across browsers. One popular solution to this issue is using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as normalize.css.  http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

</div>

			<h1> <span style="color:#E00000"> Box Sizing  </span> </h1>

				<br>
					HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
					Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
					There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
				<br>

					<b> Code  -  Test   - Refine </b>
					<br>
						Structure - Visually Box 
						Tags - heading 
						Size of the boxes 
						How to position 
						Once layout is complete 
						Time for smaller details 
				<br>

					Look for Natural Boxes 
					Look for repeated styles and Semantic elements 
					Write your HTML 
					Apply Styles  (big to small)
					Fix the small things
